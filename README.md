# Image-Based-Language-Detection
In this project ,we worked in python language on Tesseract and OCR . The program takes
images as input, runs some functions and give confidence points to a certain
language on the basis of how much the text in image is matching to a certain
language and then the language with highest confidence is printed.
Skills used - Python,Tesseract,OCR
